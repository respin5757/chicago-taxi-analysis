## Revenue and Profitability

Short, city-center trips yield a higher return on a per-mile basis. Although longer rides—such as those to suburbs or airports—may have higher total fares, their revenue per mile is lower. This suggests concentrating efforts on downtown areas and shorter trips could enhance both efficiency and profitability.

## Hourly Demand Patterns
![hourly-activity-heatmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24f384f6-bef0-471f-8364-678f72f44998)

Peak demand typically occurs on weekdays during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (5–8 PM) rush hours. Aligning driver schedules and fleet distribution with these timeframes can improve service and earnings. On weekends or late evenings, different patterns may emerge, tapping into nightlife or event-based demand.

Digital and credit card payments often correlate with higher tip percentages compared to cash. Encouraging cashless transactions—such as credit card or mobile payments—may increase overall earnings. This behavior could reflect convenience, cultural norms, or the simplicity of tipping through digital interfaces.

Recognizing these seasonal patterns can guide marketing efforts, strategic fleet placement, and dynamic pricing, ensuring sustained profitability even during slower periods.
